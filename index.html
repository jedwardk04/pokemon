    <h1> These are my favorite Pokemon</h1>
    <h4>In no particular order</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dragonite</li>
        <li>Obstagoon</li>
        <li>Buzzwole</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Dragonite </h2>
    <img src="https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/1/1c/0149Dragonite.png" height="300" width="300">
    <p>This <strong>Gen1</strong> Pokemon is amongst the fan favorites for many reasons. The first being that it is the only sole dragon type from generatoin 1, and is considered a <em>pseudo-legendary</em></p>
    <h5><em>Gen 1 refers to the first generation of pokemon released aka R/B/Y</em></h3>

    <h2>Obstagoon</h2>
    <p>Obstagoon is a <strong><em>divergent</em></strong> evolution of the Galarian Zigzagoon. In this relative to the normal type Zigzagoon line, it gains a dark typing, which is very useful. And also looks incredibly punk, goth, and metal at the same time. </p>

    <h2>Buzzwole</h2>
    <p>What's not to love about a bug/fighting type Pokemon, that looks like an alien verison of prime Arnold Schwarzenegger? Buzzwole is in a class of Pokemon called the <em><strong>Ultra Beasts.</em></strong> These handful of powerful legendary Pokemon entered our world through a wormhole, and defy many normal laws of Pokemon structure.</p>
    <p><em>I have not played this generation of games, but have encountered and adored the Ultra Beasts in </em><strong>Pokemon Go</strong></p>
